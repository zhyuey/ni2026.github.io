<p>Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) involves computing collision-free paths for multiple agents from their starting locations to given destinations in a known environment. This problem finds diverse applications, from robot coordination to traffic management. Researchers in artificial intelligence, robotics, and theoretical computer science have been actively exploring various MAPF problem variants and solution approaches. This workshop aims to bring these researchers together to present their research, discuss future research directions, and cross-fertilize the different communities.</p>

<p>WoMAPF 2025 is kindly supported by <a href="https://www.symbotic.com/">Symbotic</a> and <a href="https://www.search-conference.org/">SoCS</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Recent Advances in MAPF: Constrained Planning, Temporal Logic, and LLM-Assisted Planning, by <a href="https://chuchu.mit.edu/">Chuchu Fan</a> (MIT)</strong></p>

<p><img src="./images/chuchu.jpg" width="200" /></p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>
In this talk, we explore recent advances from my group that tackle complex planning challenges in multi-robot systems. First, we present a hierarchical framework for solving the Constrained Multiple Depot Traveling Salesman Problem (CMDTSP), efficiently incorporating real-world constraints such as battery limits and inter-agent conflicts to improve solution quality and computational efficiency. Next, we discuss a novel approach to multi-agent motion planning under complex temporal constraints using signal temporal logic (STL), where timed waypoints enable task allocation and collision-free motion planning for nonlinear and nonholonomic agents. Finally, we introduce AutoTAMP, a method that leverages large language models (LLMs) as translators and checkers to bridge natural language task descriptions with task-and-motion planning, enabling robots to jointly reason about tasks and motion under intricate environmental and temporal constraints.</p>

<p><strong>Bio:</strong>
Dr. Chuchu Fan is a pre-tenure associate professor at AeroAstro and LIDS at MIT. Before that, she was a postdoc researcher at Caltech and got her Ph.D. from ECE at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Her research group, Realm at MIT, works on using rigorous mathematics, including formal methods, machine learning, and control theory, for the design, analysis, and verification of safe autonomous systems. Chuchu is the recipient of an NSF CAREER Award, an AFOSR Young Investigator Program (YIP) Award, an ONR Young Investigator Program (YIP) Award, and the 2020 ACM Doctoral Dissertation Award.</p>

<p><strong>From Click to Delivery: Challenges and Opportunities in Multi-Agent Path Finding at Amazon, by <a href="https://www.amazon.science/author/federico-pecora">Federico Pecora</a> (Amazon Robotics)</strong></p>

<p><img src="./images/fede-pic.jpeg" width="200" /></p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>
Amazon tackles the problem of coordinating hundreds of thousands of robots to go from a website click to a delivery at your door. We leverage problem, heuristic search, and ML to solve this huge optimization problem. In this talk I will provide an overview of the underlying motion, allocation, perception, and manipulation sub-problems, and discuss some of the challenges and opportunities their integration poses for research in MAPF.</p>

<p><strong>Bio:</strong>
Federico Pecora leads the Movement Science team at Amazon Robotics. His team studies algorithms for efficient motion planning and coordination, with the aim of improving the efficiency the world’s largest fleet of mobile robots. He leads Amazon Robotics’ effort to develop a Foundation Model for structured field mobile robots.

<p><strong>Intelligent Automation for Laboratory Diagnostics, by Rayal Prasad (Siemens Healthineers)</strong></p>

<p><img src="./images/Rayal_Headshot.jpg" width="200" /></p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>
The demand for fast and accurate in-vitro diagnostics is ever-increasing. Laboratory automation has provided a means to efficiently scale diagnostics operations, leading to complex automation systems that rely on hundreds of various components interacting with each other.</p>

<p>What starts as a tube of blood goes through a unique set of operations on these systems that are specific to patient requirements – this calls for intelligent flexible automation that can maximize system throughput. However, safety and reliability are also key, as errors could mean redrawing a pediatric sample or delaying a critical medical decision in an emergency room.</p>

<p>Everyone in the diagnostics business understands that improving speed and reliability doesn’t just help improve the profits of labs; it helps save lives. In this talk, Rayal Prasad will briefly introduce in-vitro diagnostics and the intricate laboratory automation systems that touch millions of patients’ lives every year. Rayal will detail how advancements in MAPF can improve these operations and describe some of the adjacent open challenges in this space.</p>

<p><strong>Bio:</strong>
Rayal Prasad is a Staff Research Scientist with the Digital Technology and Innovation group at Siemens Healthineers, a global healthcare company that specializes in medical devices and technology. With his focus on applying intelligent robotics to automate and improve healthcare, he has made significant contributions to the company’s laboratory diagnostics portfolio.</p>

<p>At Siemens, Rayal has worked on various applications of AI for in-vitro diagnostics and is an experienced innovator with over 30 patents to his name. Currently, he is working on enabling labs to work more efficiently through AI-driven automation of highly complex diagnostics systems. This is a critical industry with an ever-increasing demand for testing, where even small improvements lead to large-scale patient impact.</p>

<!-- _Information on the other panellists will be available soon._ -->

<!-- We've confirmed the participation from Amazon Robotics and Symbotic – both are leading companies in robotics and warehouse automation. We're also reaching out to other companies who are applying automation in diverse and innovative ways to further enrich the discussions. -->
